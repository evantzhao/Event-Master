Event-Master 2014
============

An event planner optimized for Omlet. Written in HTML. 

Allows users to create and plan a social gathering between old and new friends on the Omlet platform. Invites are sent out according to the chat that the event was first created in, or according to manual selections from the user's contact list. 

Functions by sending out a RDL into a chat. When invitees follow the link, they view another page that displays information about the event in question, and allows them to notify everyone whether they are attending the event or not. Questions, or comments, can be sent to the whole group in a separate chat.
